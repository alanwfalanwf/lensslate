# Lens Slate

Lens Slate is a free photography app for iOS and Android to help you keep track of the configuration of manual lenses as you shoot.

When you use a _digital_ lens on a digital camera body, information about the lens model, focal length, and focal ratio is typically  recorded in the image file. 

When you use a _manual_ lens, this information is not recorded. Later, you might remember which manual lens you used for a particular photograph, but you often won't remember the focal ratio or, for zooms, the focal length. 

Lens Slate helps you keep track of this information.
